## üß≠ Overview

This project investigates how NVIDIA stock returns co-move with the S&P 500 index. Using log returns, we model conditional volatility with **univariate GARCH(1,1)** and estimate time-varying correlation with the **DCC-GARCH model**.

---

## üß™ Technologies

- **Language**: R  
- **Libraries**: `rugarch`, `rmgarch`, `ggplot2`, `tseries`, `zoo`, `PerformanceAnalytics`, `patchwork`

## ‚ùì Research Question

> How do volatility and correlation between NVDA and the S&P 500 evolve over time?

---

## üìä Dataset

- **Source**: Yahoo Finance  
- **Assets**: NVDA, ^GSPC (S&P 500 Index)  
- **Period**: 2013‚Äì2024 (daily)  
- **Variable**: Adjusted closing prices ‚Üí log returns

---

## üîç Exploratory Analysis

- ADF & KPSS tests confirm **stationarity** of log returns
- **NVDA** shows stronger volatility clustering compared to the **S&P 500**
- Rolling correlations demonstrate a **structural shift in co-movement post-2020**
- PACF and ACF plots guide the choice of model order

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Modeling

- **Univariate GARCH(1,1)** applied to NVDA and GSPC individually
- **DCC-GARCH(1,1)** captures **dynamic conditional correlation**
- Models estimated using the `rugarch` and `rmgarch` packages

---

## üß™ Model Diagnostics

We validate model assumptions using several tests:

- **Ljung-Box Test** confirms absence of autocorrelation in standardized residuals
- **Jarque-Bera Test** indicates **non-normality**, as expected in financial returns
- **ARCH LM Test** confirms presence of ARCH effects (justifying GARCH models)
- **Sign Bias Test** detects **asymmetric effects**:
  - For NVDA, no significant sign bias (suggests symmetric model is sufficient)
  - For GSPC, **strong sign bias** detected ‚Äî negative/positive shocks affect volatility differently ‚Üí GARCH may be misspecified

## üìà Forecasting

We produce 100-step-ahead forecasts for conditional covariance and correlation using the fitted DCC model.

### üîç Forecast Interpretation:
- The forecasted **covariance and correlation remain nearly flat** after the red vertical line.
- This flatness occurs because **GARCH-based forecasts quickly stabilize to their unconditional levels** when no new shocks are present.

---

## ‚úÖ Results

- **High Persistence**: NVDA Œ±+Œ≤ = 0.957, GSPC Œ±+Œ≤ = 0.962  
- **DCC Œ±+Œ≤ = 0.742** ‚Üí dynamic correlations are stable but evolving  
- **Average correlation** ~0.57; rises sharply after 2020  
- **Volatility and co-movement increased significantly post-COVID**

---

## üßæ Conclusion

- The GARCH(1,1) model captures volatility clustering in both series.
- DCC-GARCH effectively models **time-varying correlation**.
- A key insight: **NVDA became more correlated with the broader market (S&P 500) after 2020**, possibly due to its increased market cap and inclusion in major indices.
- While GARCH(1,1) suffices for NVDA, GSPC may benefit from asymmetric models.
