## üß≠ Overview

This project investigates how NVIDIA (NVDA) stock returns co-move with the S&P 500 index. Using log returns, we model conditional volatility with **univariate GARCH(1,1)** and estimate **dynamic conditional correlation** with the **DCC-GARCH** framework.

## üß™ Technologies

- **Language**: R  
- **Libraries**: `rugarch`, `rmgarch`, `ggplot2`, `tseries`, `zoo`, `PerformanceAnalytics`, `patchwork`

## ‚ùì Research Question

> How do volatility and correlation between NVDA and the S&P 500 evolve over time?

---

## üìä Dataset

- **Source**: Yahoo Finance  
- **Assets**: NVDA, ^GSPC (S&P 500 Index)  
- **Period**: 2013‚Äì2024 (daily)  
- **Variable**: Adjusted closing prices ‚Üí log returns

---

## üîç Exploratory Analysis

- **Stationarity confirmed** via ADF and KPSS tests for log returns
- **High volatility clustering** observed in NVDA compared to the S&P 500
- **Rolling correlation structure** reveals **stable moderate correlation** before 2020, followed by more volatile and higher correlations after 2020
- **ACF/PACF patterns** suggest autocorrelation in GSPC but not NVDA
- NVDA shows signs of behavior shift around 2020‚Äîpossibly tied to broader tech-sector momentum or pandemic-related volatility

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Modeling

- Univariate **GARCH(1,1)** models were fitted for both NVDA and GSPC
- Joint modeling via **DCC-GARCH(1,1)** captures evolving co-movements
- Model diagnostics confirm good fit: residuals pass Ljung-Box and ARCH tests
- **Sign Bias Tests** were run to assess asymmetry and leverage effects

## üìà Forecasting

<img src="https://github.com/eledon/Dynamic-Volatility-and-Correlation-Modeling-of-NVDA-and-the-S-P-500/blob/main/readme_plots/DCC_GARCH_forecast.jpg" width="600"/>

### üîÆ Forecast Explanation

- The red **vertical line** separates observed data from **100-step-ahead forecasts**
- The **blue horizontal line** shows the long-term average (mean) for comparison
- The **flat line** behavior in the forecast occurs because the **DCC-GARCH model converges to a long-run conditional expectation** when no new data is available
- This is typical and expected in models where the correlation process is mean-reverting and there's no additional shock data

---

## ‚úÖ Results

- **High volatility persistence**:  
  - NVDA: Œ± + Œ≤ = 0.957  
  - GSPC: Œ± + Œ≤ = 0.962  
- **Dynamic correlation** (DCC): Œ± + Œ≤ = 0.742  
- **Pre-2020 correlation** was stable and moderate  
- **Post-2020 correlation** surged and became more volatile  
- **Forecasts** indicate that correlation is expected to stabilize again

---

## üß† Interpretation & Practical Use

### üìä Insights

- NVDA's behavior became **more correlated with the S&P 500 after 2020**, possibly due to macroeconomic or market structure changes
- The increase in correlation **implies reduced diversification benefits** when holding NVDA and the S&P 500 together
- Investors and analysts can use this modeling approach to **monitor risk exposure** and **adapt portfolio strategies** over time

### üîß Use Cases

- **Portfolio risk modeling**  
- **Dynamic hedging strategies**  
- **Monitoring time-varying exposure to market risk**
- Can be extended to other tech stocks or ETF constituents

---

## üßæ Conclusion

DCC-GARCH modeling captures how assets behave **not just individually (volatility)** but **together (correlation)**. NVDA's increasing alignment with the S&P 500 after 2020 is a valuable signal for:

- Asset managers looking for diversification
- Analysts exploring market regimes and tech-sector dynamics
- Students and researchers interested in applied time series modeling
